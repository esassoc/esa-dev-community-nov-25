# Esa Dev Community November 2025

## Lets make a game in Angular!

Format:
* The entire group will be split into three breakout rooms.
* Each room will implement a segment of the code that relies on the other segments. Some minimal contracts are defined in `game-contracts.ts`.
 * Room 1: Implement the Game Service. See: `game-service.instructions.md`
 * Room 2: Implement the canvas with Game Objects. See: `game-canvas.instructions.md`
 * Room 3: Implement a UI overlay to track score and add controls. See: `game-scoreboard.instructions.md`
* Each room will submit a PR.
* Rejoin main room.
* Merge and "play" the game.
 * Does it work?

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
